Test project to demonstrate an iOS 5 bug / issue. To see the issue:

1. Run the app using iOS 5 simulator or device
2. Bring up a modal by clicking a button
3. Smulate memory warning (for devices go to some apps that are memory intensive)
4. Switch to another app (if you have not done so already)
5. Come back to the app
6. Dismiss the dialog

See the blank screen.
